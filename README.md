# ML-DIABETES-PREDICTION

I perform some ML algorithm on Diabetics dataset

The problem is classify whether the person has diabetics / not ( 0 / 1 )

For this problem, 
i used some classification ml algorithm like   1) Logistic Regression

                                               2) Decision Tree
                                               
                                               3) SVM
                                               
                                               4) KNN
                                               
                                               5) Random Forest Tree
                                               
                                               6) Naive Bayes
